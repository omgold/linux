/// A wrapper around a blk-mq [`struct request`]. This represents an IO request.
///
/// # Implementation details
///
/// There are tree states for a request that the Rust bindings care about:
///
/// 1. Request is owned by block layer (refcount 0) or a [`URef`] is referencing the request.
/// 2. Request is owned by driver but with no [`ARef`] or [`URef`] referencing
///    the request (refcount 1).
/// 3. Request is owned by driver with exactly one [`URef`] referencing the request
///    (refcount >= 2).
///
/// We need to track 1 and 2 to make sure that `tag_to_rq` does not issue any
/// [`ARef`] to requests not owned by the driver, or to requests that have a
/// [`URef`] referencing it.
///
/// We need to track 3 to know when it is safe to convert an [`ARef`] to a
/// [`URef`].
///
/// Note that driver can still obtain new `ARef` even if there is no `ARef`s in existence by using
/// `tag_to_rq`, hence the need to distinct B and C.
///
/// The states are tracked through the private `refcount` field of
/// `RequestDataWrapper`. This structure lives in the private data area of the C
/// [`struct request`].
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// * `self.0` is a valid [`struct request`] created by the C portion of the
///   kernel.
/// * The private data area associated with this request must be an initialized
///   and valid `RequestDataWrapper<T>`.
/// * `self` is reference counted by atomic modification of
///   `self.wrapper_ref().refcount()`.
